# Web-Crawler
  Developed a program that was designed to crawl through a list of initial URLs and create a directed graph of nodes that represent the  relationship between URLs. Employed a PageRank Algorithm to determine the numerical weight of each URL that represented the relative  importance of the URL in the dataset.
